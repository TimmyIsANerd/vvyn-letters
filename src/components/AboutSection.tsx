              I'm <strong className="text-foreground">Winifred Liam</strong> — a PsyD professional-in-training and a creative strategist with over half a decade of experience supporting ADHD founders and entrepreneurs. I am building a startup in corporate micro-mental health, designed to deliver quick, impactful mental health interventions that restore clarity and resilience in the workplace.

              My work lives at the intersection of storytelling and psychology, where creativity and strategy meet to bring ease to people who often operate in overdrive — scholars, founders, and creatives. I translate complexity into clarity, helping high-capacity individuals find grounding without losing their edge.

              vvynletters is part of that practice: a therapeutic process and creative offering that invites people to slow down, work with what truly matters, and release the pressure of constant striving. It's about being seen as you reach for what you're capable of — in business, academia, and creative life.
