              <strong className="text-foreground">Winifred Liam</strong> is a storyteller and communications strategist with over five years' experience transforming complex ideas into narratives that inspire action.

              Currently pursuing a BSc in Applied Psychology and on the path to a PsyD, she explores how storytelling can serve as micro–mental health support: everyday practices that ease stress, untangle thoughts, and foster clarity. Through vvynletters, Winifred unites her expertise in story and psychology to offer courses, consulting, and reflections that help people write their way into ease and growth.
